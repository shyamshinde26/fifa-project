### Project Overview

 We are data scientists who wishes to make it big by becoming a football club manager. Our aim is to found out the best squad for the upcoming football championship.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
MSE andR^2R 
2
 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Here we are trying to find the best squad for the team where we are selecting the players using machine learning. So first we find the distribution of players by their playing position. Then we calculate the overall wage of the player we find our champion team. 


### Challenges faced

 We used a linear regression model to calculate the transfer fees to buy a new player. Here we are improvising our result by using the polynomial features.
